\section{Problem 1}
\label{sec-1}

To begin, we would like to implement a threaded hash table with
chaining. To perform chaining, we first must implement a list. In pure
C, without classes, we resort to structs and pointers. The list is
implemented to be generic, using void pointers to store data.

\begin{verbatim}
/* -------------------------------- */
/* ----------- List ops ----------- */
/* -------------------------------- */

typedef struct node {
    void *data; //generic data
    struct node *next; //successor node
} node;

node* node_create(void *data, node *next) {
    node* newnode = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));
    newnode->data = data;
    newnode->next = next;
    return newnode;
}

node* node_push(node* head, void *data) {
    node* newnode = node_create(data, head);
    head = newnode;
    return head;
}

node* node_append(node* head, void *data) {
    node* current = head;
    while (current->next != NULL)
        current = current->next;
    node* newnode = node_create(data, NULL);
    current->next = newnode;
    return head;
}

node* node_search(node* head, void *data) {
    node* current = head;
    while (current != NULL) {
        if (current->data == data)
            return current;
        current = current->next;
    }
    return NULL;
}

void node_dispose(node* head) {
    node *current, *temp;
    if (head != NULL) {
        current = head->next;
        head->next = NULL;
        while (current != NULL) {
            temp = current->next;
            free(current);
            current = temp;
        }
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

The typical list interface is found, with an additional memory
management operation, \verb~node_dispose~, to free the list.

Looking ahead to problem 2, we know we will need to place instances of
a 15-puzzle into our hash table. Thus, to simplify implementation, we
will construct the hash table specifically for the data structure
chosen for the 15-puzzle. For simplicity, a puzzle state will be
represented as a $4 \times 4$ array, containing the numbers 0
through 15. The address occupied by 0 represents the empty tile,
whereas the remaining numbers represent the tiles in order, i.e., 1
resides in the upper left corner, 4 in the upper right, 13 in the
bottom left, etc. This arrangement allows operations on puzzle states
to perform very fast, nearly indistinguishable from constant
time. This will become relevant when we are moving tiles around to
solve the game. 

In the hash table implementation, we will consider a set of entries
and a set of pthread locks, with each lock associated with a size \verb~k~
block of entries.

\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct entry {
    unsigned int key;
    node* values;
} entry;

typedef struct hashtable { // of size P
    int num_entries;
    pthread_rwlock_t locks[NLOCKS];
    //pthread_mutex_t locks[NLOCKS];
    entry** table;
} hashtable;
\end{verbatim}

To create a new hashtable, we will allocate the appropriate memory for
the entries and initialize all entry keys to zero, and all values to
\verb~NULL~. The values will eventually be a list of all states associated
with the respective keys. As with the list, we must create a routine
to free a created table from memory. However, here we must also take
care to dispose of each pthread lock we had created.

\begin{verbatim}
// init table with keys=0 and no values
hashtable* create_table() {
    entry** tab = malloc(P*sizeof(entry*));
    hashtable* newtable = malloc(sizeof(hashtable));
    newtable->table = tab;
    for (int i=0; i<P; i++) {
        newtable->table[i]->key = 0;
        newtable->table[i]->values = NULL;
    }
    for (int j=0; j<NLOCKS; j++) {
        //pthread_mutex_init(&newtable->locks[j], NULL);
        pthread_rwlock_init(&newtable->locks[j], NULL);
    }
    return newtable;
}

void free_table(hashtable* h) {
    for (int i=0; i<P; i++) {
        node_dispose(h->table[i]->values);
    }
    for (int j=0; j<NLOCKS; j++) {
        //pthread_mutex_destroy(&h->locks[j]);
        pthread_rwlock_destroy(&h->locks[j]);
    }
    free(h->table);
    free(h);
}
\end{verbatim}

Among the most challenging tasks for problem 1 is designing a somewhat
intelligent hash function for gamestates. While chaining removes the
need for extreme cleverness, a good hash function will still try to
evenly distribute values among the table. Efficiency will also be of
great importance. Here we will take the product of the first row of
the puzzle, and modulo by a number \verb~P~. Namely, the maximum possible
product is $32670 = 12\cdot 13 \cdot 14\cdot 15$, and we will modulo
by \verb~P~ = 10007, a prime number.
